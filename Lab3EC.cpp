1. Design and write a program using the character data type that prints this character string Hi!  to the console. Hint: this is NOT a 
    string representation of Hi! , but the character representation. Read chapter 2 in your text book for more details

2. Design and write a program that uses the C++ string class. The program should have three variables with the following names(verbiage, age 
    and verbiage_end). The verbiage variable should be assigned the string "Today I am " , the age variable should be assigned a string value 
    of 25 and the verbiage_end variable should be assigned the string " years old!".  Concatenate the three variables and print the result to 
    the console.

3. Design and write a program that adds two floating point values together and print the result to the console.

4. Design and write a program to print Avogadro's number using E notation. You should create a variable to hold the number and print the result
     to the console. Hint: Avogadro's Number is : 6.02214076 × 1023

5. Design and write a program that converts the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius. Also ensure you use floating point data
    types for your variables. Hint: use the formula C = (Fº -32) * 5/9 . Print the result to the console using cout.

6. Design and write a program that calculates the area of a circle, given the formula : 𝐴=𝜋𝑟2 . Let pi = 3.1415 and let the radius r = 19

7. Design and write a program that calculates the volume of a sphere, given the formula:𝑉=43𝜋𝑟3 Let 𝜋 = 3.1415, and radius r=7

8. Design and write a program that calculates the square footage of a new home. The length of the house is 50 feet and the width of the home 
    is 32 feet. Hint: use the equation A = Length x Width. Print the correct unit along with the result to the console.
